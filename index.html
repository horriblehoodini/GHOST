    GHOST
  </h1>
  <p>
    a group of seven individuals were asked to participate in a project known as GHOST. the project involved them taking pictures of themselves, and a medium would ask spirits in the afterlife to draw what the individual would look like in the afterlife. this is an artist's redrawing of the images created by those spirits.
